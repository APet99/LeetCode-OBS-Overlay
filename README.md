What do we want to do?
- We want to query LeetCode to get general statistics:
        - Number of problems solved (Easy, Medium, and Hard)
        - Number of total attempts (Easy, Medium and Hard)
        - UserName
        - Anything else??
  
- We want to check to see if there are any changes. If so, we should
update the stream overlay.
  


- Debating between an executable and/or a twitch extension. (Likely executable so the
  data can be updated in OBS.)
